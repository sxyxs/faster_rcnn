Most models are trained with the 3x schedule (~37 COCO epochs). Although 1x models are heavily under-trained, we provide some ResNet-50 models with the 1x (~12 COCO epochs) training schedule for comparison when doing quick research iteration. 



C4: Use a ResNet conv4 backbone with conv5 head. The original baseline in the Faster R-CNN paper.
